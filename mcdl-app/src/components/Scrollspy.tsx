					<h4 id="list-item-1">Folder</h4>
					<p>
						The folder feature in the app serves as a robust
						organizational tool, enabling you to group and store
						related items or files in one dedicated space. By
						creating folders, you can keep your documents, media,
						and other data neatly arranged, which simplifies
						navigation and management. This feature is particularly
						useful for users who work with multiple projects or
						categories, as it ensures that everything is easy to
						locate and access.
					</p>
					<h4 id="list-item-2">List</h4>
					<p>
						The list component acts as a central hub for managing
						tasks, items, or records within the app. Designed with
						usability in mind, it offers a clear overview of all
						your entries in one place, allowing for quick scanning
						and selection. The list is integrated with the scrollspy
						functionality, so as you scroll through different
						sections, the corresponding list entry is highlighted.
					</p>
					<h4 id="list-item-3">List Item</h4>
					<p>
						Each list item represents an individual entry within
						your larger list, providing detailed information and
						specific actions for that entry. You can click on a list
						item to view more details, mark tasks as complete, or
						edit the information as needed. This granularity allows
						for precise control over your data.
					</p>

					<h4 id="list-item-4">AI</h4>
					<p>
						The AI feature is the appâ€™s intelligent assistant,
						designed to augment your productivity by offering smart
						recommendations and automated insights. Leveraging
						advanced algorithms, the AI component can help you
						analyze your data, predict trends, or even suggest the
						next best actions to take based on your behavior.
